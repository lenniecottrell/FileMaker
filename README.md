## Chart Playground

Chart Playground is a testing file for integrating the [Apex Charts](https://apexcharts.com) Javascript library into FileMaker Pro. 

The file has two samples - one with a multiple data series on a single chart and one with synchronized charts. These charts are extremely interactive! Try click-and-dragging a selection of data points, or using the other view controls in the top right.

## Chicken Cutie Media

This is a personal media database I built for my partner and me in our home (lovingly named "Chicken Cutie" because our house is cute and we have chickens in the backyard). It's designed to be an iPad app. 

This database accesses REST APIs from Google Books, OMDB (Open Movie Database), and IGDB (Internet Game Database). You can view the basic functionality [on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VzAN9zurqg "Chicken Cutie Media")

There is a known issue where sometimes the media item you search for isn't the one that's returned. That's because of the API call response, and I'm working on building a selection option where you can choose the result you want from the search.

#### Future features:
* Scan the barcode on a book and search via ISBN
+ Search using different or multiple parameters
